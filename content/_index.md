# Civkit

The Civ Kit combines the Nostr architecture with the Lightning Network, prioritizing “privacy and security through escrowed trades, decentralized identity, moderation, a P2P messaging protocol, and know-your-peer (KYP) oracles for adjudication,” The system aims to support all kinds of trading, including goods and services.

## Civkit Node

The CivKit Node represents an experimental NIP-01 Rust relay, complemented by ongoing development of communication gateways for BOLT8 Noise transport and BOLT4 sphinx onion routing. Alongside this, there is a companion client binary designed specifically for development and testing purposes.

## Orage

Orage lightning node, is constructed in LDK, will offer in-built features such as custom scripts. These scripts will provide greater flexibility in the types of applications that can be built on the Lightning Network. The ultimate goal is to encourage the development of more 'Lightning-aware' applications. The integration of custom scripts, escrow, Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), and Taproot will collectively facilitate this ambition.
